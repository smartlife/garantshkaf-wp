# Maintenance guidelines

When editing PHP source files in this repository, keep the existing comments up to date. Add or update short descriptions near the top of each PHP file explaining its purpose. Do not clutter HTML templates with comments intended for users. All comments should be written in Russian (technical terms may remain in English).
